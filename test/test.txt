Below is a **cleaned-up, consistent rewrite** of the 7 tasks, keeping them **as-is**, but polishing language, tightening acceptance criteria, and making them **Jira / Confluence ready**.
I’ve **not added new scope**—only clarified and standardised wording.

---

## 1) Create SRS Security Role for SVT Manager

**Title:** Create SVT Manager SRS Security Role (Dataverse)

**Description:**
Create a new Dataverse security role for the **SVT Manager** persona following the SRS model and least-privilege principle.
The role must provide access to:

* SVT custom pages (navigation entry)
* Relevant SVT tables required for Manager activities

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* SVT Manager security role exists in the target environment(s).
* A user assigned **only** this role can successfully access the SVT Manager landing page.
* Role does not grant unintended access outside SVT scope.

---

## 2) Create Azure AD Security Group for Manager (SRS)

**Title:** Create Azure AD SRS Group for SVT Manager persona

**Description:**
Create an Azure AD security group for **VOA SVT Manager**, aligned with the SRS approach.
This group will act as the **single source of truth** for Manager role membership.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Azure AD security group is created using the agreed naming convention.
* Group ownership is assigned in line with governance requirements.
* Group is suitable for mapping to a Dataverse AAD group team.

## 3) Create Dataverse Team and map to AAD Group

**Title:** Create Dataverse AAD Group Team for SVT Manager and link Security Role

**Description:**
Create a Dataverse **AAD Group Team** mapped to the SVT Manager Azure AD group.
Assign the SVT Manager security role to the team (not to individual users).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Dataverse team exists as an **AAD group team**.
* SVT Manager security role is assigned to the team.
* Users added to the Azure AD group automatically gain Dataverse access via team membership.

## 4) Resolve current user team membership in Custom Page

**Title:** Custom Page: Resolve logged-in user’s Dataverse teams and persona flags

**Description:**
In the Canvas Custom Page, implement logic to determine the logged-in user’s persona by resolving Dataverse team membership and setting persona flags, including:

* `isManager`
* `isCaseworker`
* `isQC`
* `isNonSVT`

**Implementation Notes:**

* Use Dataverse connector to query **TeamMembership** (user → teams).
* Cache results in a global variable on app start or page load.
* Design logic to be extensible for future multi-role scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* App reliably identifies whether the user belongs to the SVT Manager team.
* Role resolution completes within acceptable performance limits on first load.
* Persona flags can be reused across screens for conditional rendering and navigation.

---

## 5) Render Manager landing tiles based on role flags

**Title:** Custom Page: Display Manager landing tiles based on Manager role

**Description:**
Update the landing screen so that when `isManager = true`, the following tiles are displayed:

* Sales Record Search
* Manager Assignment
* QC Assignment
* QC View
* Caseworker View

Each tile must navigate to the appropriate screen or page.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Manager users see all Manager landing tiles and can access each function.
* Non-Manager users do not see Manager-specific tiles.
* Navigation from each tile routes correctly.

---

## 6) Solution & ALM packaging

**Title:** Package changes into solution and align ALM activities

**Description:**
Add all relevant changes to the solution and coordinate with the DevOps team for team creation and deployment activities.

The solution must include:

* SVT Manager security role
* Custom page updates and navigation logic
* Any required environment variables or configuration (if applicable)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Solution contains all role and UI changes.
* Solution imports successfully into target environment(s).
* Deployment approach is aligned with DevOps and ALM practices.

---

## 7) Document the changes

**Title:** Document SVT Manager role and landing page changes

**Description:**
Update the relevant Confluence page to document:

* SVT Manager role and access model
* Azure AD group and Dataverse team mapping
* Manager landing page behaviour and role-based visibility logic

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Confluence documentation is updated and accurate.
* Changes are clear to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

If you want next:

* I can **map these tasks back to the original user story** with traceability, or
* Convert this into a **single Jira Epic + task hierarchy**, or
* Reduce this further into a **one-slide delivery summary** for stakeholders.
