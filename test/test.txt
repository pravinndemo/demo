Here’s a clean, concise, **professional** email you can send to the PO explaining the creation of 3 SRS roles and how SVT will resolve personas when multiple roles are assigned.

# 📧 **Email to PO – SVT SRS Roles & Persona Resolution Approach**

**Subject:** SVT – Proposed SRS Roles & Multi-Role Persona Resolution

Hi <PO Name>,

As part of the SVT role-based access design, we would like to confirm the security model we plan to implement across Azure AD (SRS), Dynamics security roles, and the SVT UI.

### **1. Creation of 3 Dedicated SRS Roles**

To support the four personas in SVT (Manager, Caseworker, QC and Non-SVT Users), we will create **three dedicated SRS roles**, each mapped to a corresponding Dynamics security role:

| SRS Group                  | Dynamics Role       | SVT Persona |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| **SRS_VOA_SVT_Manager**    | SVT Manager         | Manager     |
| **SRS_VOA_SVT_Caseworker** | SVT Caseworker      | Caseworker  |
| **SRS_VOA_SVT_QC**         | SVT Quality Control | QC Reviewer |

Any user who does not belong to any of these groups will automatically be treated as a **Non-SVT User** and will only see the read-only search screen.

### **2. Persona Resolution (Supports Multiple Roles per User)**

SVT will support scenarios where a user has **one, two, or all three roles assigned**.
Since multiple roles may be granted for operational reasons, the system will resolve the user’s “active persona” using a clear priority order:

**Persona Priority:**

1. **Manager**
2. **QC**
3. **Caseworker**
4. **Non-SVT User**

**Examples:**

* If a user has both **Manager + QC**, they will operate as **Manager**.
* If they have **QC + Caseworker**, they will operate as **QC**.
* If they only have **Caseworker**, they will operate as **Caseworker**.
* If they have none, the user will fall under **Non-SVT User**.

This approach ensures:

* Consistent access behaviour
* No accidental elevation or restriction
* Flexibility for future team structures
* Cleaner audit trails, as the active persona is unambiguous

---

### **3. Impact on the SVT UI & Backend**

* The SVT custom page will show tiles and screens based on the resolved persona.
* All backend APIs/custom actions will enforce the same persona permissions.
* Users with multiple roles will still have only *one* effective persona during each session.

Please let us know if you are happy for us to proceed with creating the three SRS roles and implementing the above persona-resolution mechanism.

Thanks,

If you want a shorter or more formal version, I can refine it.
