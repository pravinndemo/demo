Here is a **one-page executive MoM** — concise, decision-focused, and suitable for **senior stakeholders / architects / steering group**.

# **Executive Minutes of Meeting (MoM)**

**Topic:** SVT / VT Architecture & DevOps Strategy – Welsh Reform
**Date:** *[add date]*
**Attendees:** Mark, Munib, Praveen, DevOps, SVT Team

---

## **Purpose**

To confirm the architectural and DevOps approach for delivering **Sales Verification Tool (SVT) / VT** as part of Welsh Reform, while minimising risk to the existing **CT application**.

---

## **Key Decisions**

### **1. Solution Isolation**

* SVT / VT will be delivered in a **separate Dataverse solution**.
* The solution will include:

  * Custom Pages
  * PCF controls
  * SVT / VT-specific plugins and tables
* The solution will be **deployed independently** from the CT master solution.

---

### **2. Repository & Project Strategy**

* SVT / VT will remain in the **existing VOA Azure DevOps project**.
* **No new ADO project** will be created.
* **No separate repository** will be created.
* New SVT-specific projects (plugins, PCF, custom pages) will be added to the **existing VOA repo**.

**Benefit:**
Reuse of shared/common assemblies, performance optimisations, and existing service connections.

---

### **3. CI/CD Pipelines**

* A **dedicated CI/CD pipeline** will be created for SVT / VT.
* The pipeline will:

  * Build and deploy only the SVT / VT solution
  * Operate independently of CT releases
* Existing CT pipelines will **ignore SVT paths** to prevent unintended deployments.

---

### **4. Shared Code & Reuse**

* Common logic will be consolidated into a **shared library**.
* Both CT and SVT plugins will reference shared components to avoid duplication and improve maintainability.

---

### **5. Navigation & Go-Live Control**

* SVT / VT will be accessed via the **existing CT model-driven app**.
* Only the **sitemap** will be shared.
* SVT / VT navigation will be:

  * **Feature-flagged**
  * Controlled via **security roles / permissions**
  * Optionally **date-based** for go-live
* Navigation will remain hidden or inactive until production go-live.

---

## **Risk & Dependency Management**

* No current hard technical dependencies between CT and SVT solutions.
* Any future dependencies (e.g. sitemap changes) will be managed through:

  * Feature flags
  * Controlled solution deployment
  * Early architectural review

---

## **Outcome**

The agreed approach provides:

* Clear isolation of SVT / VT delivery
* Independent deployment and release control
* Reuse of shared code and infrastructure
* Minimal risk to the existing CT application

---

## **Next Steps**

* Finalise SVT solution structure
* Set up dedicated SVT CI/CD pipeline
* Implement shared library strategy
* Apply feature-flagged sitemap configuration

If you want, I can:

* Turn this into a **slide (single PowerPoint page)**
* Add a **simple architecture diagram**
* Prepare a **formal decision record (ADR)**
